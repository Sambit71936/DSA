Time Complexity

Rate of increase in time with respect to input size

Rules to calculate Time Complexity:

1. Always calculate TC in terms of worst case
2. Avoid the constant values
3. Avoid lower bound

Three Types:

1. Big Oh - Worst case (upper bound)
2. Theta - Average Case 
3. Omega - Best Case (lower bound)

Example:

for i in range(1, n+1):
for j in range(1, n+1):

TC = O(n^2)

Space Complexity

Space complexity is the total amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion
